      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        PrometheusIQ was founded by experienced trial attorneys and legal writers who recognized the need for strategic, surgical litigation support.
        We believe persuasive advocacy starts with clear thinking and exceptional writing — and we bring those values to every motion, brief, and trial support package we deliver.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Our work is quiet but powerful. Whether you're filing a complex dispositive motion, preparing for oral argument, or just too deep in trial to handle another filing,
        PrometheusIQ is here to lift the load and sharpen the impact.
